<h2>
1. Overview
</h2>

Letâ€™s build a simple and interactive web-based color picker to control WS2812 RGB LEDs using the ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP32 will host a web server that allows you to choose any color from your browser and instantly apply it to the LEDs. This kind of setup is perfect for ambient lighting systems, DIY smart lamps, or just a fun way to learn about web interfaces and IoT
